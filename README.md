# Installation
The first step to installing our project is going to the repository on github(https://github.com/calebp80/Project-2). Once there you will go to the green button that says CODE on it. Click on that button and copy the repo to your clipboard.
The next step is go to your gitbash and navigate to your desktop. Once there you will write the following "git clone" then paste the repo link and press enter. You now have successfully installed our repository on your computer! 
The next step is installing our modules that we used to create this project. To get there we first have to get this repo onto your vscode. Using gitbash, navigate to the repo you just created and write the following "code .". You now have vscode up with our project. Now open a new terminal for installing the modules. Write the following "npm install" then the following modules that you are required to install are "express", "express-session", "express-handlebars", "dotenv", "mysql2", and "sequelize".
