Presentation:


You and your group will give a 10-minute presentation on your project, with about 7 minutes devoted to the presentation itself, followed by a 3-minute Question & Answer session. Use this Project Presentation Template (Links to an external site.) to address the following:

Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for future development.
